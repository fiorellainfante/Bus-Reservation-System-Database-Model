# Data-bases---university-project
This project designs and implements a normalized SQL database for a long-distance bus reservation system in Argentina. It models companies, services, cities, clients, seat types, and bookings, including multi-stop routes and two-floor buses. The repository includes the ER diagram, database schema, sample data, and the SQL queries required.
