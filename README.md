# Bus Reservation System – Database Model
This project implements a normalized SQL database for a long-distance bus reservation system in Argentina, modeled using Docker, MariaDB, and DBeaver. It covers companies, services, cities, clients, seat types, and reservations, including multi-stop routes and two-floor buses. The repository includes the ER diagram, database schema, sample data, and required SQL queries.
